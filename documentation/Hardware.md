# Quark Processor

> Intel Quark is a line of 32-bit x86 SoCs and μCs by Intel, designed for small size and low power consumption, and targeted at new markets including wearable devices. The line was introduced at Intel Developer Forum in 2013. Quark processors, while slower than Atom processors, are much smaller and consume less power. They lack support for SIMD instruction sets (such as MMX and SSE)[1] and only support embedded operating systems. Quark powers the Intel Galileo developer microcontroller board.
